The GAG deletion was the only mutation detected in a large number of patients from different ethnic backgrounds. Most (90%) patients with an atypical presentation had no identifiable mutation in the DYT1 gene. At least 4 different background haplotypes were observed with the GAG deletion, indicating that the mutation had arisen more than once to cause ITD. Given the highly variable phenotype and reduced penetrance observed in ITD, the identification of the DYT1 mutation was a major advance for accurate diagnosis of the disorder.

(2011) identified a polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) located between the noncoding exons 1a and 1b of the C9ORF72 gene. The maximum size of the repeat in healthy controls was 23 units, whereas it was expanded in members of a large family with frontotemporal dementia and/or anyotrophic lateral sclerosis mapping to chromosome 9p21 (FTDALS; 105550) (Boxer et al., 2011). Affected individuals had expanded repeat units ranging from 700 to 1,600. Further analysis identified this expanded hexanucleotide repeat in 16 (61.5%) of a series of 26 families with the disorder, as well as in 11.7% of familial FTD and 23.5% of familial ALS from 3 patient series. Sporadic cases with the expansion were also identified. Overall, 75 (10.4%) of 722 unrelated patients with FTD, ALS, or both were found to carry an expanded GGGGCC repeat, and DeJesus-Hernandez et al. (2011) concluded that it is the most common genetic abnormality in FTD/ALS. Longer repeats were associated with the A allele at SNP rs3849942, which marked a disease haplotype. The expanded repeat is located in the promoter region of C9ORF72 transcript variant 1 and in intron 1 of transcript variants 2 and 3. Tissue from affected individuals showed reduced or absent mRNA levels of C9ORF72 variants 1 and 3 compared to nonrepeat carriers, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. However, protein levels of these variants were similar to controls, and analysis of patient frontal cortex and spinal cord tissue showed that the transcribed expanded GGGGCC repeat formed nuclear RNA foci, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism.

Simultaneously and independently, Renton et al. (2011) identified the GGGGCC expanded repeat as a cause of FTD/ALS in families reported by Pearson et al. (2011) and Mok et al. (2011). The expanded repeat was also found in 46.4% of Finnish familial ALS cases and in 21% of sporadic cases. PCR assays showed that Finnish controls had between 0 and 22 repeats. FISH studies showed that the expansion in a family from Wales (Pearson et al., 2011) was at least 250 repeats. In addition, an expanded repeat was found in 102 (38.1%) of 268 familial ALS probands of European origin. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of expression in frontal cortex tissue from patients and controls did not detect conclusive changes in RNA levels and produced inconsistent results. Nevertheless, Renton et al. (2011) postulated that a disruption in RNA metabolism likely underlies this disorder.

(2011) identified a polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) located between the noncoding exons 1a and 1b of the C9ORF72 gene. The maximum size of the repeat in healthy controls was 23 units, whereas it was expanded in members of a large family with frontotemporal dementia and/or anyotrophic lateral sclerosis mapping to chromosome 9p21 (FTDALS; 105550) (Boxer et al., 2011). Affected individuals had expanded repeat units ranging from 700 to 1,600. Further analysis identified this expanded hexanucleotide repeat in 16 (61.5%) of a series of 26 families with the disorder, as well as in 11.7% of familial FTD and 23.5% of familial ALS from 3 patient series. Sporadic cases with the expansion were also identified. Overall, 75 (10.4%) of 722 unrelated patients with FTD, ALS, or both were found to carry an expanded GGGGCC repeat, and DeJesus-Hernandez et al. (2011) concluded that it is the most common genetic abnormality in FTD/ALS. Longer repeats were associated with the A allele at SNP rs3849942, which marked a disease haplotype. The expanded repeat is located in the promoter region of C9ORF72 transcript variant 1 and in intron 1 of transcript variants 2 and 3. Tissue from affected individuals showed reduced or absent mRNA levels of C9ORF72 variants 1 and 3 compared to nonrepeat carriers, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. However, protein levels of these variants were similar to controls, and analysis of patient frontal cortex and spinal cord tissue showed that the transcribed expanded GGGGCC repeat formed nuclear RNA foci, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism.

Simultaneously and independently, Renton et al. (2011) identified the GGGGCC expanded repeat as a cause of FTD/ALS in families reported by Pearson et al. (2011) and Mok et al. (2011). The expanded repeat was also found in 46.4% of Finnish familial ALS cases and in 21% of sporadic cases. PCR assays showed that Finnish controls had between 0 and 22 repeats. FISH studies showed that the expansion in a family from Wales (Pearson et al., 2011) was at least 250 repeats. In addition, an expanded repeat was found in 102 (38.1%) of 268 familial ALS probands of European origin. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of expression in frontal cortex tissue from patients and controls did not detect conclusive changes in RNA levels and produced inconsistent results. Nevertheless, Renton et al. (2011) postulated that a disruption in RNA metabolism likely underlies this disorder.
